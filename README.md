# ðŸ“§ Phishing Email Analysis - README

## Overview
This README provides context for the phishing email analysis report included in this project. The email sample was obtained using the **CanIPhish simulator** and analyzed for common phishing indicators.

## Contents
- `phishing-analysis.pdf`: A detailed analysis of a phishing email titled **"Payment Review Needed Before EOD"**.

## Key Findings
- The email pretends to be from a company CEO, but the sender domain (`authwebmail[.]com`) does not match the actual company domain.
- Includes a suspicious attachment (`Payment-Authorization-Form.docx`).
- Uses urgent language to pressure the recipient.
- Explicitly instructs the recipient to **reply via email only**, avoiding verification through other channels.
- Displays traits of **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** attacks.

## Tools Used
- CanIPhish Phishing Simulation Platform
- Manual inspection of content and sender fields

## Purpose
This analysis demonstrates how to identify and document key phishing indicators in simulated or real-world scenarios.
